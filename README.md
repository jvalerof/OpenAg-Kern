This is the repository for the OpenAg Model for Kern County

OpenAg is an a framework for modeling agricultural production and water use using hydro-economic models. OpenAg employs deductive models on various programming languages to simulate croping decisions following the princples of economics of production theory. 

OpenAg-Kern is an application for Kern County in California developed for as part of the NSF Funded Grant 1639268. INFEWS/T2: The sustainability-productivity tradeoff: Water supply vulnerabilities and adaptation opportunities in California?s coupled agricultural and energy sectors (http://infews.web.unc.edu/). 

The application models agricultural production for a collection of 20 crop groups following the CA Department of Water Resources for 18 irrigation areas in the southern San Joaquin Valley mostly located in Kern County. The model calibrates to a  2011-2013 base dataset for land and water use using various land use sources, and 2015 US dollars data on crop prices and yields from the corresponding County Agricultural Commissioner Reports, and UC Davis agricultural cost and return studies.
