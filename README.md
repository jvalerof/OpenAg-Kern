Compiled monthly landuse and AW data from DWR for DAU regions in the Central Valley in 2011-2015.

Data from the Department of Water Resources for monthly time steps of applied water (AW) and land use for 20 standardized crop groups were downloaded as csv files. However, thousands of these files existed for  each year downloaded, with a total of 5 years accumulating to over 25,000 individual files to be scraped for relevant values.

The files in this repository document the processes to consolidate and sort this data as well as the resultant values of interest for this project.
