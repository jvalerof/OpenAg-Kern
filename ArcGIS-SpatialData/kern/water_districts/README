The folder “water_districts” contains three groups of water districts: “kern_water_district_adjust”, 
“friant_kern_county_contractors”, and “other_districts”. The most relevant attributes for each shapefile are: 
“AGENCYNAME” (Name of the water district) and “District” (a code assigned by the UC Merced team).
